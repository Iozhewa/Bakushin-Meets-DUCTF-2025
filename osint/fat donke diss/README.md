  The king has returned! MC Fat Monke is known to have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AveragePrimateThreat">YouTube</a> channel and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mc-fat-monke/monke-bars">SoundCloud</a> account. Their YouTube videos are known to sneak in flags by the frame...<br><br>

  Last year took ~3 minutes for any flagsign, but it seems our <em>average primate threat</em> was eager to cut down to the chase. Here is a frame at the 0:57 mark, which I raised to 1080p resolution-<br>

  <br>Team Monke, always.
